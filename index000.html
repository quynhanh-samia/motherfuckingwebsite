<body><h1>This is the <i>Test</i> of  Quynh Anh and Samia's Website.</h1>

<p class="st">Really, it is.</p><h2>Seriously, you guys think that a website doesn't need some styling?</h2>

<p>I really dont know what i need to do.


<p>

<span class="wr">SO, i try to edit this page
</span>, hahaha.Maybe it will become</p><h2>The best test website</h2>

<h2>I hope this site will be work</h2>

<p>I tried refresh this page many time because i dont have live test developing software.</p><h2>I tried put some pictures</h2>

<div class="fancyPositioning">

<div class="picture-left"><img src="img/day6.jpg" title="korean day6 band">

<p class="caption">DAY6 est un groupe de rock sud-cor√©en produit par le label Studio J.</p>

<div class="tleft">

<p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a

<span class="mfw">test site
</span> so include some pictures to give a context.</p>

<p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>

<p>You see that group ? They are happy, you should be too.</p>
</div>
</div><h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>

<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your

<span class="mfw">test site
</span> with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>
<blockquote>

<span>Good design is as little design as possible.
</span><author>Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</author>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not entirely true, look at that

<span class="mfw">test site
</span>. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p><h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">

<span class="mfw">test site
</span></a> and the <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">

<span class="mfw">test site
</span></a>.</p>

<p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still

<span class="mfw">test site
</span>), so go check 'em out.</p>

<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"

<p>The cat picture was taken from the cool <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka Public Domain) content.
The author is <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/1899441-1899441/">1899441</a> (seriously? His username looks like my PIN code!), the <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cat-pets-cat-s-eyes-mieze-dear-451377/">old picture</a> was
by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/">aloiswohlfahrt</a>,
but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute.
You can <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a> if you think that this decision goes against the rules
of a good looking
